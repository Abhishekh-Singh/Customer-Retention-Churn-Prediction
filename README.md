# Customer Retention-Churn Analysis

Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stopped using your companyâ€™s product or service during a certain time frame. Predicting customer churn is a challenging but extremely important business problem especially in industries where the cost of customer acquisition (CAC) is high such as technology, telecom, finance, etc. The ability to predict that a particular customer is at a high risk of churning, while there is still time to do something about it, represents a huge additional potential revenue source for companies.
